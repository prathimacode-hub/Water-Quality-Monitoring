# Water-Quality-Monitoring

Challenge hosted by **Omdena Kutch Chapter**

The challenge focuses on creating a Water Quality Monitoring Dashboard that visualizes the parameters to determine the water quality.

It was a phase of exploration while contributing for various tasks involved from knowing water quality standards, gathering satellite data, parameters identification, model development and integrating it with deployment.

This feature would aid in checking out the conditions in real-time. We have taken the parameters of Salinity, Chlorophyll, Suspended Matter, Dissolved Organic Matter, Dissolved Oxygen, Turbidity, Temperature and pH. and have used Google Earth Engine to attain remote sensing data.
